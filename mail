Subject: Request for Project Allocation
Dear [RMG],

hello,  I am Vaibhavi, writing to express my interest in being allocated to a project and I am open to work in any technology project and wants to inform you that I have successfully completed the IICS (Informatica Intelligent Cloud Services) training during my ILP (Initial Learning Program). I would like to highlight that I have successfully completed the Ocean Certifications. 

I would like to bring to your attention that I have been on the bench since completion of my ILP and have not receive any opportunity to work in project or interview calls for project allocation. During my time on the bench, I have proactively engaged in upskilling activities to stay updated with the latest industry trends and technologies. 

Thank you for your time and attention. I genuinely appreciate your support and consideration in allocating me to a project where I can contribute effectively. Should you require any additional information or have any further questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.

Thank you once again.

Sincerely,
Vaibhavi Kulkarni,
